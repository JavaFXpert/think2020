## Quantum Game Challenge (Build a quantum 8-ball)

1. Take the [Create your first quantum circuit](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/start-iqx/drag-drop/first-circ) tutorial.
2. In the IBM Quantum Experience Circuit Composer, create a three-wire circuit whose measurements are randomly distributed among 000 - 111.
   - View the **Statevector** and **Measurement Probabilities** from the **Visualizations** tab (bar graph image) on the left side of the page.
   - Observe the results when running your circuit on a backend quantum system or simulator. The shortest queues are typically with the 32 qubit simulator `ibmq_qasm_simulator in ibm-q/open/main`
3. Create the circuit using Python and Qiskit in an IBM Quantum Experience Jupyter notebook.
   - Make the program print out a message unique to each measured state (e.g. state 000 message might be "The quantum 8-ball says it's most likely"). For reference, here are the [possible answers from the original Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball#Possible_answers).
   - If you'd like some hints, please see [this partial solution](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/think2020/blob/master/quantum_8ball_hints.ipynb)
4. If you have time:
   - Rather than using a simulator, use the `from_instruction()` and `sample_counts()` methods of the `qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` class. Your circuit should not have measure operations. 
   - Expand the circuit to four or five wires.
   - Add various single and multi-qubit gates to the circuit (in the Circuit Composer first if you'd like) and observe their effects on the measurement probabilities and results.
